Simple resizable and moveable grid for dashboards. Mostly CSS, not much fluff.

TODOs.

- [] Bug on move as span is allocated to index in grid and transfers to moved section
- [] persist dash state and reload 
- [] add concept of layouts -> [metrics] and switching and persist
- [] adding new metric type not requiring changes to demo
- [] proptypes, typescript?
- [] verify all callbacks and listeners... leaking?
